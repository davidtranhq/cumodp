Installation instructions of the CUMODP library
==================================================

These instructions are for UNIX and are illustrated in
bash format. We assume that the CUMODP library was unpacked
at the level of the user's home directory.
==================================================

0/  Make sure you have downloaded and installed the latest version of   
    Nvidia CUDA toolkit from the following address:

      https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit

    Then, you can run following command to find the version of your
    CUDA installation:

      nvcc -V

    For example, if you have installed CUDA version x.y, you must be able to see the version info which ends like the following line:

      "Cuda compilation tools, release x.y ..."

    Please set following environmental variables:
    
      CUDA_PATH=/path/to/cuda-x.y/bin
      CUDA_LIB_PATH=/path/to/cuda-x.y/lib64

      export PATH=$PATH:$CUDA_PATH
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CUDA_LIB_PATH

    Finally, update the bash environment:

      source ~/.bashrc

=======================================
1/ Define the environment variable for the source tree of 
   the cumodp library

   export CUMODP_HOME=/path/to/cumodp/library

=======================================
2/ Define the environment variable for the source tree of 
   the modpn sub-library

    export MODPN_HOME=$HOME/cumodp/modpn/

=======================================
3/ Increment of the library load path

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CUMODP_HOME/src
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$MODPN_HOME/src

=======================================
4/ Build the cumodp library 

   cd $CUMODP_HOME; make; 

=======================================
5/ Run the sanity check

    cd $CUMODP_HOME;  make check

=======================================
6/ If you have the computer algebra system "Maple", you can run
   the verification. In this case, output results are formally
   verified against their maple counterparts.

    cd $CUMODP_HOME;  make test
